# Real time tweet tracker/radar
This project uses the Twitter API to examine recent tweets about a particular subject (in this case, "football"). It retrieves the most recent tweets (not including retweets), identifies the users who posted them, and displays the frequency of tweets per user in a bar graph. The script gives a quick visual summary of the most active users tweeting about the selected topic and guarantees that API rate limits are followed. Trend tracking, engagement analysis, and simple social media monitoring can all benefit from this tool.
